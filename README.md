# Welcome to my GitHub page! ðŸ‘‹ - Adishree Sane

Computer Science graduate specializing in AI and robotics, enabling robots to sense, move, and think! Dedicated to developing intelligent systems focusing on perception, navigation, and motion planning in both simulation and real-time.

Curious, driven, and ready to go all inâ€”I'm here to grow fast, solve real problems, and contribute to something bigger! Letâ€™s connectâ€”Iâ€™d enjoy a quick chat


## ðŸŽ“ Experience
### YewSavin - Researcher
-  Micro-Robotics: Leading in-depth literature reviews on biological locomotion and motion planning, analyzed 15+
 papers, and evaluated 5+ techniques till now to inform energy-efficient, mobile micro-robotic designs.
- Automated an experimental system using ESP32 and PID control, boosting precision by 15% in dynamic processes. 
- Used control algorithms for robotic chemical handling, including sensors, and actuators, to optimize performance.
- Applied genetic algorithms on vector datasets to optimize drug lead identification and enhance the compound's solubility.

### Agnel Robotics Club - Robotics Software Developer
- Engineered prototypes for Asia-Pacific robotics competitions (ROBOCON), solving complex tasks with Python and C++.
- Integrated deep learning algorithms with OpenCV for object detection and coded various mechanisms on Arduino.
- Refined control algorithms for 3 and 4-wheeled holonomic locomotion improving navigation with ROS and Gazebo.

### Capgemini - Software Associate Intern
- CNN-based document system using VGG16 and InceptionResNetV2, achieving 85% accuracy across 16 document sets.
- Utilized TensorFlow and Keras to make models with parallel stacking and hyperparameter tuning to boost accuracy.
